## Installation
Download the Source Code, Put it in a folder and run "dotnet new install ." inside the folder.

Just Press the green button in Visual Studio! 
But close VMWare then because booting doesnt work from visual studio rn. you need to open VMware manuely and change the ISO path to the ISO in "projectFolder\bin\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64\native\"
